The program contain four modules to implement BFS.

Solver.py, Board.py, State.py and Search.py.

Solver: Finds the path to goal state.

Board: contains the datastructure Node.

State: Calls Board and contains a data structure for states.

Search: It has the implementation for bfs.


In order to run the program, I have used spyder with python version 2.7.14. Save all the files in one folder and run Solver.py, you will be prompted for input. 

INPUT: Enter your puzzle problem as input. Solver will check if the puuzle is solvable and accordingly create possible childern and have their path stored in L-left, U-up, R-right and D-down format.

OUTPUT: Once the execution is completed, output will display number of nodes expanded, time taken, memory consumed and path to goal state.
